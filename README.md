# Book Notes

Inspired by [Keyvan Akbary](https://github.com/keyvanakbary)'s **[book notes](https://github.com/keyvanakbary/book-notes)**, I have created this repository to force myself writing summaries, in this way, I can collect information about the books I read. As Keyvan says, this procedure helps me in the process of assimilating the book.

* [Clean Architecture](clean_architecture.md)
* [Extreme Programming Explained](extreme_programming_explained.md)
* [Versioning in an Event Sourced System](versioning_in_an_event_sourced_system.md)
