# Book Notes

Inspired by [Keyvan Akbary](https://github.com/keyvanakbary)'s **[book notes](https://github.com/keyvanakbary/book-notes)**, I have created this repository to force myself writing summaries, in this way, I can collect information about the books I read. As Keyvan says, this procedure help me on  the book assimilation process.
